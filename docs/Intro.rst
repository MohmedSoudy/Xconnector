Xconnector
===========

Xconnector is a software package designed to easily retrieve, and visualize metabolomics data from different database sources. The goal of Xconnector is to connect different metabolomics databases in one place. The first five databases implemented in Xconnector are:

1. The Human Metabolome Database [HMDB](http://www.hmdb.ca/).
2. The Livestock Metabolome Database [LMDB](http://lmdb.ca/).
3. The Yeast Metabolome Database [YMDB](http://www.ymdb.ca/).
4. The Toxin and Toxin Target Database [T3DB](http://www.t3db.ca/).
5. ReSpect for Phytochemicals DataBase [ReSpect](http://spectra.psc.riken.jp/).
6. KEGG: Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes [KEGG](https://www.genome.jp/kegg/).
7. The Small Molecule Pathway Database [SMPDB](http://smpdb.ca/).

In future, we aim to include the most used databases for metabolites data.
